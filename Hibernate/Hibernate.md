# ORM
* Object Relational Mapping.
* Insert. Update, delete and select .in Object format only 

* className- Must be mapped with – tableName
* VariableName- Must be mapped with – columnName

* should be done by programmer using XML/Annotatios concept.
* Then ORM convert  Object-->ROW
* Here , ORM only generates SQL Query.


## Design Pattern:-

> This concept is used to improve applications performance by reducing code ,
time, and memory of on application.


### Hibernate has 3 Java Technologies
1. JDBC
2. JTA
3. JNDI And one Non-Java Technology “XML”.

####  **JDBC =Java Database Connectivity**
* It is used to perform database operations. Like insert, update, delete and select.

####  **JTA = Java Transaction API**
* It is used to either confirm (commit) changes or cancel (rollback) changes done at
database.

####  **JNDI= Java Naming Directory Interface**
* It is used to create connection-pool and execute SQL Statement faster.

## Hibernate Programming design:-

* JDBC works on primitive data even object is given, it converts Object Data to Primitive Data then
SQL Query return manually by programmer.

* Hibernate follows ORM Concept so, it converts object to Row even Row to Object. 
* SQL query also generated by ORM (Hibernate), But Programmer has to follow coding files in below order.

1. Configuration file
2. Model/Entity/POJO Class
3. Mapping code(XML/Annotation)

####  1. Configuration file
It is used to provide all details related to DB and Hibernate.
* a). it will store data in key = value format.
* b). file name should have extension ___.cfg.xml
* c). recommended name is:-`hibernate.cfg.xml`
* d). Few keys are:- driver_Class, url, dialect , show_sql


####  2. Model/Entity/POJO Class
Model Class + Rules given by hibernate:-


####  3. Mapping code(XML/Annotation)
####  4. Test Class [POJI-POJO]
1. class must have package statement
2. Class must have public (no. of table =no. of classes)
3. variables must be private // (no. of column =no .of variables)
4. Default constructor with setters and getters (mutators).
5. Can override methods from Object , those are(3)
toString(), equals(), hashCode()non-final ,non-static,non-private.
6. Annotations:-JPA Annotations(Java Persistency API=JPA)


# Hibernate Application Files:-
To write one application we should write 4 files, given as below:
1. Model class (Class)
2. Mapping Code (XML/ANNOTATION)
3. Configuration file (XML)
4. Test Class (class)


### Keys are given below (8 keys)

1) hibernate.connection.driver_class=oracle.jdbc.driver.OracleDriver
2) hibernate.connection.url=jdbc:oracle:thin@localhost:1521:xe
3) hibernate.connection.username=system
4) hibernate.connection.password=system
5) hibernate.dialect=org.hibernate.dialect.OracleDialect
6) hibernate.show_sql=true
7) hibernate.format_sql=true
8) hibernate.hbm2ddl.auto=update

 
## dialect
 Dialect is class it will be generate the SQL Query when programmer performsoperation, for every database dialect is different
##### EX:- 
* Oracle DB= OracleDialect
* MySQL DB= MySQLDialect
* Sybase DB= SybaseDialect
* H2 DB = H2Dialect
All dialect are defined in package org.hibernate.dialect

## show_sql:-
* show_sql:- it is a Boolean property default value is false. To see generated SQL on Console make value as true.
## format_sql:-
* format_sql:- it is a Boolean property default value is false. It will display sql clause by
clause (part by part)

```sql
Select
Eid ,nam
From
Emptab
Where
Eid=10
Value must be set to ‘true’
```


## hbm2ddl.auto:-
here hbm= hiberante mapping
* ddl=Data definition language(create /alter/drop in SQL) it has four possible value. Those are:-
* A. Validate:- in this case hibernate creates no tables programmer has to create or modify tables
* manually. It is only default value.
* B. Create:- hibernate creates always new tables, if table exist then it will be drop.
* C. Update:- it creates new table if table not exits else uses same tables.
* D. Create-drop:- this option is used for testing process not in development, it’s new table and
* performs operation at last table will be drop.
