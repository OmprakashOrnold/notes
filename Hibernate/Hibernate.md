# ORM
* Object Relational Mapping.
* Insert. Update, delete and select .in Object format only 

* className- Must be mapped with – tableName
* VariableName- Must be mapped with – columnName

* should be done by programmer using XML/Annotatios concept.
* Then ORM convert  Object-->ROW
* Here , ORM only generates SQL Query.


## Design Pattern:-

> This concept is used to improve applications performance by reducing code ,
time, and memory of on application.


### Hibernate has 3 Java Technologies
1. JDBC
2. JTA
3. JNDI
* And one Non-Java Technology “XML”.

1. **JDBC =Java Database Connectivity :-**
* It is used to perform database operations. Like insert, update, delete and select.

2. **JTA = Java Transaction API**
* It is used to either confirm (commit) changes or cancel (rollback) changes done at
database.

3. **JNDI= Java Naming Directory Interface**
* It is used to create connection-pool and execute SQL Statement faster.

## Hibernate Programming design:-

* JDBC works on primitive data even object is given, it converts Object Data to Primitive Data then
SQL Query return manually by programmer.

* Hibernate follows ORM Concept so, it converts object to Row even Row to Object. 
* SQL query also generated by ORM (Hibernate), But Programmer has to follow coding files in below order.

1. Configuration file
2. Model/Entity/POJO Class
3. Mapping code(XML/Annotation)
4. Test Class [POJI-POJO]
