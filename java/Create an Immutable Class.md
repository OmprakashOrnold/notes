## Create an Immutable Class
When we create an object of an immutable class, we cannot change its value.

 **For example,** String is an immutable class. Hence, we cannot change the content of a string once created.


#### we can also create our own custom immutable classes.

* declare the class as **final** so it cannot be extended
* all class members should be **private** so they cannot be accessed outside of class
* shouldn't contain any **setter methods** to change the value of class members
* the getter method should return the copy of class members
* class members are only initialized using constructor


```java
// class is declared final
final class Immutable {

  // private class members
  private String name;
  private int date;

  Immutable(String name, int date) {

    // class members are initialized using constructor
    this.name = name;
    this.date = date;
  }

  // getter method returns the copy of class members
  public String getName() {
    return name;
  }

  public int getDate() {
    return date;
  }

}

class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {

    // create object of Immutable
    Immutable obj = new Immutable("Programiz", 2011);

    System.out.println("Name: " + obj.getName());
    System.out.println("Date: " + obj.getDate());
  }
}

```
