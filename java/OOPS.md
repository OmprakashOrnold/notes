## OOPs Concepts â€“ Object Oriented Programming

The main objective of the object-oriented paradigm is to implement real-world entities, like, Objects, Classes, Abstraction, Inheritance, Polymorphism, etc.


### What Is Object-Oriented Programming(OOP)?
* Object-Oriented Programming refers to programming that helps us to create the objects that we want and create methods to handle these objects. 
* The principle of OOP is to create objects, reuse the objects throughout the program, and manipulate these objects to get desired outputs.


### Benefits of Object-Oriented Programming

* Improved productivity during software development
* Improved software maintainability
* Faster development sprints
* Lower cost of development
* Higher quality software


### What is an Object?

* The object is a bundle of data and its behavior or methods. 
* Objects have two characteristics: states and behaviors.

**Object**: Student
**State**: name, age, gender
**Behavior**: study, play, run

So if we need to write a class based on states and behaviors of the Student. 


```java
class Student {
  //States as instance variables
  String name;
  String gender;
  int age;

  //Behavior as methods
  void study() {
    //Write code here
  }
  void play() {
    //Write code here
  }
  void run() {
    //code
  }
}
```
